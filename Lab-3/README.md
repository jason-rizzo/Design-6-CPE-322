# CPE 322 - Lab 3 
## Python 
--- 
### Installation 

Python was already installed on the Windows system used for this lab, and the Python 3 prefix in the terminal was set as "python" instead of the standard "python3." The required packages were also installed, with other unstated dependencies being installed as Python required them to run specific scripts.

### Script 1: `julian.py` 

After the installation of Python and the required libraries, the lab tested the installation through running several test scripts. `julian.py` prints the current date, as well as the Julian calendar date and the Modified Julian calendar date for this date.
